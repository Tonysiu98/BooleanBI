# Formalising The Boolean BI Display Calculus in Isabelle/HOL
Author: Tony Siu

## Project Aim
To formalise a display calculus proof system for the bunched logic Boolean BI in the 
proof assistant Isabelle/HOL, and to prove that system sound and complete with respect to its Hilbert axiomatisation.

## System specification
Version of Isabelle: Isabelle2019 (During development)

Compatible with Isabelle2020

Developed using Isabelle/JEdit


## File organisation
def.thy contains basic definition of Boolean BI including definition of display

display.thy contains display theorem of BBI calculus

soundness.thy contains soundness theorem of BBI display calculus

completeness.thy contains completeness theorem of BBI display calculus
