# Formalising The Boolean BI Display Calculus in Isabelle/HOL
Author: Tony Siu

## Project Aim
To formalise a display calculus proof system for the bunched logic Boolean BI in the 
proof assistant Isabelle/HOL, and to prove that system sound and complete with respect to its Hilbert axiomatisation.

## File organisation
def.thy contains basic definition of Boolean BI including definition of display

display.thy contains display theorem of BBI system

soundness.thy & completeness.thy as the name suggested, they are theorem about soundness and completeness of BBI system
